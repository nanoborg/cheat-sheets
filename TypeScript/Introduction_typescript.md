# Introduction to TypeScript

## What is TypeScript?

* It's JavaScript Superset, A language building up on JavaScript
* Adds new **_Features_** + **_Advantages_** to JavaScript
    Features

    * Type Checking
    * Use modern IDE features
    * Use  of Next-gen JS features that will get compiled down into workarounds even for older browsers

* Features are compiled to JS "workarounds", possible errors are thrown

TypeScript is not read by the browser, it's just a build language that will have to be compiled to JavaScript for anything to work.
