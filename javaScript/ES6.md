# What is ES6

ES6, a.k.a. JavaScript, a.k.a ECMAScript 2015 is an enhanced version of the JavaScript programming language. It envelopes new feature that aim to facilitate large-scale software development.

## 2015!?? Why So Old?

There have been other additions to ES6. Following years ES7, ES8, ES9.. how ever, none of the updates were as drastic or as exciting as those brought in ES6.

The entire set of additions from ES6 onward is sometimes referred to as "ESNext"

## So What's The Big Deal?

* More concise, less code
* Easier to read, easier to maintain
* Fun code!

ES6 is widely used in React development.


## Browsers That Don't Support ES6

The Babel compiler takes ES6 and will transpile it to ES5

* Comes built-in with any project started using Create React App.

Most of the new features are already supported in chrome.


## JSX vs ES6

ES6 is not the same as JSX.

JSX is the HTML like sytnax that the components use to render the content.
