# GitHub Summary


## What is GitHub

GitHub is a collaboration and version control platform using **Git**, which has a lot of features to track contributions and contributors.

Development can run along side working code, ideas or bugs from users and the community are submitted to **_Issues_**, developers can implement new features while taking snapshots along the way. 

When a developer feels they are ready to share the new code, a **_Pull_** request is made to share the code for review and see if any additional features or ideas can be added.

The code can easily be shared with other users using the ``` @-mention ```.

Once everyone involved is happy the new code can be **_Merged_** with the existing code.

### Key Features

* Open Source
* Streamline workflows
* Privacy
* Security

**_Issues_** is used to discuss ideas, flag issues and make collaboration easier.

* **_Assignee_** to assign anyone that has access to the repo
* **_Labels_** which can have the name changed
* **_Filters_** can be used narrow down results based on **_Labels_**, **_Assignee_**, **_Open Status_**

### Key Features

* Having a history all in the one place

## GitHub flow

### Branch

![Branch Screenshot](./screenshots/branch_git-hub.png)

By default everything in git lives on a **_Branch_**. The main project will live on **_Master_**.

Git as a workflow offers the ability to experiment or address **_Open Issues_** on an alternate **_Feature Branch_** off **_Master_**, This will not compromise the original code.

A **_Feature Branch_** should have it's own descriptive name. Any **_Commits_** made will be stored on the **_Feature Branch_**.

When ready to discuss the changes made a **_Pull Request_** can be made. A **_Pull Request_**  does not have to be perfect at first. It's something the can be refined as more changes are made. 

Once the changes in the **_Pull Request_** have been approved, the **_Feature Branch_** can be **_Merged_** back with **_Master_** and the **_Issue_** can be closed.

### Creating a Branch

## Creating a Pull Request

### What is a **_Pull Request_**?

When a change has been made and or completed it is time open a **_Pull Request_** to discuss the file with team mates. 

Github will know that files have been changed and will recommend to open a pull request, github will offer a drop down to compare any two branch's.

![Create Pull Request](./screenshots/create_pull_request_git-hub.png)

Github pre-populates the **_Pull Request_** with the **_Commit_** message. It can be updated to that others can better understand the intent of the change.

Below there is a **_Comment_** section to explain the changes that were made and why, as best practice to reference the original issue using the number sing notation **_#1_**.


When finished, choose the option to make a **_Create Pull Request_**

![Pull Request Discussions](./screenshots/pull_discussions_git-hub.png)

Similarly to how an **_Issue_** creates a discussion thread, a **_Pull Request_** creates a discussion on the changes being made to the repository. This is found under the **_Conversation_** tab.


### Files Changed

![Files Changed](./screenshots/files_changed_git-hub.png)

Here is where the change can be viewed which could be adding or removing of files.

* Text in **_Red_** is what has been removed
* Text in **_Green_** is what has been added

![Change Comment](./screenshots/change_comment_git-hub.png)

If there needs to be a **_change_** to the code, click on the **_Line Number_**

<br>

## Respond to a review

![Respond to Review](./screenshots/respond_review_git-hub.png)

A file may need to be changed, if there are instructions follow them and edit the file using the file editor.

After the **_Branch_** has been **_Merged_**, the **_Branch_** can be deleted.
