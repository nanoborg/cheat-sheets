## Escape sequences

When used in coding an _escape sequence_ is not printed the way it's written. It uses a specific command to have an affect on the printed code. 

For instance:

| command   | action    |
|   ---     | ---       |
| ```\n```  | New line (Line feed) |
| ```\r```  | Carriage Return |
| ```\t```  | Tab space between text |
| ```\b```  | Backspace a character |
| ```\v```  | Vertical Tab  |
| ```\a```  | Alarm or Beep |
| ```\0```  | Null terminating character |
| ```\"```  | Escaping quotes, "Hello "there" " |



## End of line 

Depending on the operating system **_End of Line_** can be interpreted in two ways:

* windows ```\r or \n```

* linux or mac ```\n```
