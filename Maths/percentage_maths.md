### Percentage Increase 
In crease 100 by 20%

Tip: Calculate the newest figure first e.g. 100.

    100 * 1.20 = 120
         (20%)

### Percentage Difference

    A) 100
    B) 20

    (A - B) / B

    (100 - 20) / 20 = 4 
        (80)
    4 * 100 = 400%

### Determine Original Percentage

    A) Current Amount
    B) Increase 15% which is 115% the original percentage.

    Amount / Increase 

    25 / 115 = .2174 * 100 = 21.74%

### Calculate percentage

    5 / 100 = .05 * 100 = 5%
