# What Is JSX?

Within the **_Render()_** method, React will display what looks to be HTML. It is **_JSX_** syntax that resembles HTML to allow for easily readable code.

It is compiled to lightweight javascript objects.

**_JSX_** can only render one object from the **_render()_** function. How ever if you want to have more than one object you can nest the elements inside each other.

    <div class="content-wrapper">
    
        <h1>This is the first</h1>
        <h2>This is the second</h2>
    
    </div>
