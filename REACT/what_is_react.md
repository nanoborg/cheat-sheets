# What is React?

React is a JavaScript front end library to make creating interactive UI a less painless task.

At it's core it is a JavaScript library that uses data to render the UI

Companies that use **_React_**:

and many more...

## Why was it created?

Facebook created is out of frustration using the traditional mvc model to create web pages.

The purpose being to speed up and smooth out large applications that handle data that changes over time.

Before React, rerendering meant rerendering everything on the page.

## MVC (Model View Controller)

Model - data base
View - Render the requested information  
Controller - Handle the input and connecting the model and view

There are some issues when using the MVC design pattern, when ever any information is updated, the whole or most of the webpage has to be re-rendered. If there is a lot of content to load this can causes the webpage to be laggy or glitchy and use a lot of processing power.

What would be more efficient would be to re-render only the parts that need to be updated

React can be considered as the **_View_** layer of the **_MVC_** framework.
