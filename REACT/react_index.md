# Looking At src/index.js

Index is currently loading and rendering the component.

    import React from 'react';
    import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
    import Hello from './App.js';

Importing `App from './App.js'` will import any **_default_** class or function. 


 Best practice is to explicitly import `ClassName from './App.js`
